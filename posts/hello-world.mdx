### Introduction

Hello and welcome. If you've found your way here, this is my inaugural blog post. As the new year takes shape, I've set some personal objectives, one of which is to enhance my writing skills. I believe that maintaining this blog will aid in achieving that goal. If you don't know me, I am a junior computer science student at FIU. I have been programming for a few years now, but things have recently started picking up at a pace I'm more proud of. I've learned much more within the past few months than I have prior, and this website is a reflection of that.

In this space, I'll be focusing on technology - discussing new developments, sharing knowledge I acquire, and occasionally providing tutorials. This is an entirely new venture for me, including my first experience with MDX files in a Next.js project. This post will be very short as this is my first post and I am mainly just making sure everything works.

### Closing Notes

This blog represents not just a new endeavor, but also a learning process for me. In due course, I might delve into the specifics of this journey. This blog will live as long as this website is up. If I end up making another personal website, this blog will not follow it. If you have any feedback whatsover, from not liking the font to suggesting a new feature, please feel free to email me [here](mailto:mail@anthonymham.com).

For now, I hope this finds you well, and I look forward to engaging with you in future posts!
